# The actions/cache github action allows builds of tags to use artifacts cached
# by builds of the default branch, but doesn't allow builds of tags to use
# artifacts cached by other tags. Thus to make the dependencies of the project
# available to the "release" workflow, they are built and cached by this
# workflow.
